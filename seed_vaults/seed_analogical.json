  "description": "Analogical reasoning is the transfer of relational structure from a well-understood source domain to a less-understood target domain. It is the engine of metaphor, scientific model-building, legal precedent, and high-level pattern recognition. When used rigorously, analogy is the fastest path from known to novel truth; when used carelessly, it is the root of fallacy.",
