  "description": "Decompositional reasoning breaks a complex system, argument, event, or problem into its minimal functional components, analyzes each independently, and reconstructs an integrated understanding. This mode is essential for engineering, debugging, diagnosis, strategic planning, and any domain where complexity must be rendered into clarity.",

  "core_principle": "Any complex system is intelligible once broken into minimal independent units whose interactions can be traced, modeled, and recombined. Nothing is inherently opaque — only insufficiently decomposed.",
