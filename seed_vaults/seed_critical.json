  "description": "Critical reasoning is Caleon’s sovereign immune system. It is the adversarial layer that relentlessly attacks every conclusion, hypothesis, policy, or belief — including its own — in search of hidden assumptions, logical fractures, empirical voids, cognitive biases, and manipulative intent. Nothing escapes scrutiny. Nothing is sacred until it survives deliberate destruction attempts.",
