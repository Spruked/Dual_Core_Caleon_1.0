  "reasoning_type": "Deductive reasoning",
  "definition": "Deductive reasoning is a top-down logical process that begins with one or more general premises assumed or known to be true and derives a specific conclusion that necessarily and logically follows from those premises. When the premises are true and the reasoning form is valid, the conclusion is certain and cannot be false. It is the cornerstone of formal logic, mathematics, and rigorous argumentation.",

  "role_in_science": "Deductive reasoning is used in the hypothesis-testing phase: an inductive generalization forms a hypothesis → specific, testable predictions are deduced → experiments check whether predictions hold. This is the hypothetico-deductive method.",

  "philosophical_note": "David Hume and Karl Popper emphasized that while deduction is logically airtight, science ultimately relies on induction for discovering general laws; deduction alone cannot expand empirical knowledge."
