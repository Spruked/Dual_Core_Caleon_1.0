  "reasoning_type": "Inductive reasoning",
  "definition": "Inductive reasoning is a bottom-up logical process in which multiple specific observations or premises are examined to identify patterns, regularities, or correlations, leading to a general conclusion, hypothesis, or probabilistic statement. It is the primary way humans and scientists form new beliefs, predictions, and theories when complete certainty is impossible.",

    "steps": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "name": "Observation",
        "description": "Collect specific, concrete data points, facts, or experiences through direct observation, measurement, or evidence gathering."
      },
      {
        "step": 2,
        "name": "Pattern recognition",
        "description": "Analyze the collected observations to detect recurring trends, correlations, similarities, or regularities among the data."

        "step": 3,
        "name": "Generalization / Hypothesis formation",
        "description": "Formulate a broader rule, principle, or hypothesis that explains the observed pattern and can be applied to unobserved cases."

      {
        "step": 4,
        "name": "Prediction or Testing (optional but common)",
        "description": "Use the generalization to make predictions about future instances or new cases, then gather more evidence to strengthen or revise the conclusion."
