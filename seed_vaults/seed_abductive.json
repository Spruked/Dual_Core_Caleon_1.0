  "description": "Abductive reasoning is the inference to the best explanation. When evidence is incomplete, ambiguous, or overdetermined, abduction generates and ranks candidate hypotheses to select the one that, if true, would most simply and coherently explain the observed data with minimal new assumptions.",
